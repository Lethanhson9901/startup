Start preparing to study abroad by following these steps. Research locations and universities.Start by thinking about what you\\u2019re planning to study and the countries that interest you. Then research the universities in that country, by comparing rankings, course offerings, and admission requirements for international students. Choose a program. There are many ways to study abroad, but the two most popular options are direct enrollment and third-party programs. With direct enrollment, you can apply through your home university and let their program facilitate the process, or directly enroll into a university overseas. Although a more costly route, a third-party provider can provide you with extra support with visas and the application process, arrange your housing, and even organize travel excursions. Prepare your application. While requirements may vary depending on the university, in order to study abroad, you\\u2019ll typically need to complete an application form, submit copies of your transcript and letters of recommendation, and write a personal statement. Apply for a visa. Once you\\u2019ve been accepted into your program, depending on the country, you may need to apply for a student visa. Secure housing and book your flight. If you booked your program with a third-party provider, they likely arranged housing for you already. However, if you applied directly to your host university, you\\u2019ll need to secure accommodations, whether it\\u2019s a homestay, on-campus dorm, or private apartment.
